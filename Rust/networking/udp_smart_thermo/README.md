# USD Smart Thermo

Implement a thermometer that periodically updates temperature data, receiving it from a given socket via UDP. To listen to UDP, it is suggested to run the datagram receive loop in a separate thread. Also, to test the new functionality, implement an application that simulates the operation of a thermometer that sends readings to a given UDP socket.
